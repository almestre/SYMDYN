This model was used to conduct a theoretical research on dispersal evolution in a horizontally transmitted symbiont. The results from this research were presented in a talk at the 2018 ESA Annual Meeting held in New

## Background/Question/Methods
Dispersal is an essential process in metapopulation dynamics, especifically when local disturbance affects the likelihood of local population persistence. Optimal dispersal rates are the ones that maximize metapopulation persistence. In general,
metapopulation models support the presence of a trade-off mechanism in which the optimal dispersal rate increases when intra-patch carrying capacity decreases, and it decreases with increasing mortality during dispersal (often called “cost of
dispersal”). However, under extreme intra- and off-patch conditions, a further harshening of the dispersal environment produces a counterintuitive increase in optimal dispersal rates. This study aims at exploring metapopulation dispersal
dynamics under extreme conditions in detail, by answering the following questions: i) What are the benefits of dispersal when (intra- and off-patch) environmental conditions become extreme? ii) What is the effect of disturbance intensity on the patterns of optimal dispersal strategies under these conditions? iii) What happens to the optimal dispersal rate of individuals that invade empty metapopulations undergoing extreme conditions? We used a spatially-implicit model in which ten clones varying in dispersal rates compete to persist in a metapopulation undergoing local disturbance. The model combined deterministic intra-patch dynamics with logistic, density-dependent growth, and emigration, coupled by stochastic transience among patches mediated by the dispersal environment.

## Results/Conclusions
We confirm that, in a competitive environment with extreme metapopulation conditions, a further increase in both intra- and off-patch harshness leads to higher values of optimal dispersal rate. We also identified an abundance-occupancy trade-off in dispersal between maximizing intra-patch abundance (lower dispersal) and occupancy (higher dispersal), which is conceptually similar to the dominance-tolerance trade-off known for specialist-generalist strategies. In par with this trade-off, we found that dispersal expands the tolerance limits to intra- and off-patch harshness. We also demonstrate that dispersal modifies the optimal environmental conditions in which clones outcompete each other. In addition, disturbance intensity reduces the range of intra- and off-patch environmental conditions that allows for species persistence, intensifying the effects of environmental harshness on optimal dispersal rates. Invasion conditions release higher-dispersal clones with suboptimal dispersal strategies from competitive exclusion, as a result of stochastic lost of stronger competitors at the initial invasion phase. We predict that the tolerance benefits of dispersal will be especially relevant in sink metapopulations where conditions are, by definition, more extreme, and the success of evolutionary rescue for long-term persistence should depend on the details underlying dispersal dynamics.
